# How to use it

1. First install the [Themes for Brackets extension](https://github.com/Jacse/themes-for-brackets) 
2. Drop the CSS file in the `"/your/brackets/extension/user/themesforbrackets/themes"` folder.

This will place a new menu entry under *Themes* dropdown. 

*Note: The theme is based on the bare template from [Belar / BearTheme](https://github.com/Belar/BearTheme)*
